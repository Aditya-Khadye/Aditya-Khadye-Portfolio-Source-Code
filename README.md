Welcome to my personal portfolio website! ðŸš§

This website is a work in progress (WIP) where Iâ€™m continually adding and updating content to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences. Here, youâ€™ll find highlights of my work in data engineering, machine learning, cloud computing, and AI-driven solutions.

What to Expect:

	â€¢	About Me: Learn about my background and professional interests.
	â€¢	Skills: An overview of the technical skills Iâ€™ve developed over the years.
	â€¢	Projects: A collection of the key projects Iâ€™ve worked on, including a facial recognition system and data pipeline optimization.
	â€¢	Testimonials: Feedback from colleagues and peers on my leadership, mentorship, and technical abilities.
	â€¢	Contact: Information on how to get in touch for collaborations or opportunities.

Stay tuned as I continue refining the site and adding more content. Thank you for visiting!

This README lets visitors know the site is evolving and provides a snapshot of what they can expect. Let me know if you need adjustments!
